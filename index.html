<p>My name is Vibhav and I am a sophomore CS major at Carnegie Mellon University. I have 3 years of programming experience in various languages and I love applying my knowledge to novel and real-world problems. This past summer, I worked at TripAdvisor on automated filters and internal tools. I worked both on implementing abstract algorithms to catch fraudulent reviews and designing an easy-to-use UI for the moderation team.    </p>

<p>Simply put, I want to write clean code that is intuitive to use, yet powerful in nature. The best way I have found to achieve this is to gain and utilize a theoretical base in math and computer science. </p>
